# CS425-mp2-g12: Distributed Log Membership System


This project implements a distributed group membership service as part of a distributed system. The system maintains a full membership list at each machine, keeping track of other machines that are connected and up in the network. It updates the membership list when:

- A machine joins the group.
- A machine voluntarily leaves the group.
- A machine crashes.


There are two failure detection methods included:

- PingAck
- PingAck + S

## Instructions

There are 2 versions of the code, but they work very similarily. In the "introducer" branch you will find introducer code and in the "main" branch you will find code for every other machine.


### Common Workflow

1) Pull the introducer code onto one machine

2) Pull the main branch code onto all other machines

3) Once you've picked the machine to be your introducer, go to the .env file of each machine and change the "INTRODUCER_ADDRESS" variable to match the address of the chosen introducer

4) Start the service by running *go run logging.go* on the introducer. Type *join* to join the system.

5) Do the same steps on all other machines you want to be in the system 

6) Other commands to run now are: 

    - list_mem: list the membership list
    - list_self: list selfâ€™s id
    - join: join the group 
    - leave: voluntarily leave the group
    - enable_sus / disable_sus: enable/disable suspicion
    - status_sus: suspicion on/off status
    - sus_list: command to list suspected nodes
    - client **pattern**: query all log files for a pattern

7) If you would like to induce a specific drop rate, change the "DROP_RATE" variable in the .env file
